This repository contains a set of functions to simulate a Boost Converter and estimate its degradation duting curtailment operation. It also includes different degradation models for BESS with different chemistries. 


The FLEXINET project was carried out with a Top Sector Energy subsidy from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate, carried out by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO).The specific subsidy for this project concerns the MOOI subsidy round 2020.
